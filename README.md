# LEX

Set of games for kids with dyslexia. The game types have been taken from some websites offering them but in PDF
format so I though it would be funnier if kids see the computer reacting to their speech :)

## Types of game

At the moment there are 5 types of games

- words: read the words appearing
- tale: read a page of a tale and it will reveal a picture
- fake: detect which word is real and which one is fake
- hack words: hack the string of charaters into words
- hack syllables: hack the given word into syllables

## Contibutions

### Adding games

TBD
